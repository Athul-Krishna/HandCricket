# HandCricket
Hand Cricket is a simple yet an amazing game. Playing cricket is fun, but what if you don't have the equipment? What if you want to play a sweet little game in any given moment with a computer? You've come to the right place.

It used to be the all favourite game of kids at school. Since it didnt require any additional equipments to play, it was highly popular.
So I thought of implementing it using python so that I could still play incase I was lonely.
